      Layered bands of colorful rock reveal millions of years of geologic history with unmatched vistas from the rim.\

      candy dish. Powell\'s Sweet Shoppes are a nostalgic re-creation of that classic and bygone era. On the surface \
      we sell ice cream and sweets, but you don\'t have to stand in the Shoppe too long before you realize that what\
       we really offer are memories. \'I feel like a kid in a candy store!\' and \'I haven\'t seen that since I was \

       Getting your heart rate up doesn’t have to be hard on your joints. Opposed to running or \
       plyometric workouts, cycling gets your cardio done in a low impact way. The pedals and resistance take \
       the pressure off of your knees and hips so you can focus on building muscular strength.',
